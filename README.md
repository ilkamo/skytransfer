SkyTransfer is an open source decentralized file sharing platform. Do you have difficult times **sharing files between devices**? Are you writing an email and you need to **attach different files**? Are you struggling with a ton of **pictures to share**? Let's try doing it using SkyTransfer.

Use the minimal but powerful uploader (file picker or drag&drop) for **uploading and sharing one or multiple files** by a **single link** or **QR code**.

Uploaded files are **encrypted using AES algorithm** so no one can access them without your permission. Only **sharing the link**, other people can **download and decrypt** the content you uploaded. In addition, **sharing a draft**, people can continue uploading into the same SkyTransfer **adding more files to it**. Be careful when you share a draft!

SkyTransfer supports **directories upload** and is able to manage nested folders.

Last but not least, you can **Public your SkyTransfer**. What does it exactly mean? Let's explain in with an example. Imagine SkyTransfer like a box where you can put inside different files. This box can be opened by others only if they have the correct key. There is no other way of doing it. By publishing a SkyTransfer, you send this box with all the files inside on the public Skynet. In addition, you are attaching the keys to it so, when others find it, they can use the keys to open it. Publish a SkyTransfer only when you are really aware of the consequences!
