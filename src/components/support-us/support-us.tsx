        SkyTransfer is a tool we developed with love, for Us, for You, for the
        World. We hope you enjoy it and find it useful. Forget how frustrating
        can be, sometimes, sharing files. Reimagine how file sharing experience
        should be.

        We are constantly shipping new features. We don't want to steal your
        time but if you really want, you can support Us with a donation. It's
        your way of returning the love we invested in developing SkyTransfer. We
        would appreciate it very much.
